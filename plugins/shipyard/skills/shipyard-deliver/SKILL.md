description: "Delivery (loop 3): cold start → ticket board → scope selection → worktree/PR per ticket → babysit to green (CI + CodeRabbit/Copilot re-init). At the end of the phase — integrator. Use when tickets already exist and the user explicitly wants them shipped as PRs — it opens PRs and drives merges, so invoke it deliberately, not from idle discussion."

# Shipyard deliver

Resolve this installed skill directory from its supplied absolute SKILL.md path. The plugin root is two directories above it. Run, with that absolute root:

```sh
node "<plugin-root>/host/scripts/bootstrap-shipyard-plugin.cjs"
```

This idempotently installs/enables the GSD marketplace dependency and prepares native Codex host components. On any failure stop and report the exact setup error; do not run a partial workflow. If setup registered agents for the first time, start a new Codex session before dispatching them.

Read the complete file at `${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/shipyard-native-skills/shipyard-deliver/SKILL.md` using shell expansion (CODEX_HOME takes precedence), then execute that workflow with the original user arguments. Do not summarize or substitute its runtime policy, model selection, validation, gates, or receipts.
